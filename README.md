## My triage workflow
* Planned/Planned for re-opened
* Open this as a list view in Jira
* Open every ticket in a new tab using JiraTabs
* Go to the tab on the right. 
* Read and assess
* You usually either have to assign or transition the issue
* If it’s just assign, hit ‘a’ to bring up the assignment window
* If it’s assign and transition, press ‘.’ which opens the quick action dialog. start typing “open” or “re” and you’ll get the commands. Transitioning to these commands will also let you assign at the same time.
* Close the tab
* Continue
